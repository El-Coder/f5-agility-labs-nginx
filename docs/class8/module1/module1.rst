Module 1 - HTTP/2 and GRPC DoS Attack on Unprotected Application
################################################################

| In this module you will generate **good** and malicious traffic.
| The malicious traffic will cause the good traffic to error out. We
| will utilize HTTP/2 and gRPC as part of this module.

Demonstrate the effects of an HTTP/2 and gRPC attacks on an unprotected application
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Generate legitimate traffic 
   
   - In UDF, Click on Access for the **legitimate traffic** VM and select WebShell 
   
   - At the CLI prompt start the good shell script  
  
 .. code:: shell

    ./good.sh
   
    
Output from the script: 

.. code:: shell 
 
   JUICESHOP HTTP Code:200 Finished trip with 10 points

   JUICESHOP HTTP Code:200 Finished trip with 10 points

   JUICESHOP HTTP Code:200 Finished trip with 10 points 

- Start HTTP/2 Flood attack

   - Back in the UDF class Access on the Attacker VM and select WebShell
   - At CLI prompt start the HTTP/2 Flood: 

.. code:: shell 
   
    ./scripts/http2flood.sh

- Click back on to the WebShell on the legitimate VM. Did the output from
   the script change? Output now shows the HTTP/2 service is
   experiencing an outage.

.. code:: shell

  JUICESHOP HTTP Code:200
        details = "Received http2 header with status: 502"
        debug_error_string = "{"created":"@1650395963.222837020","description":"Received http2 :status header with non-200 OK status","file":"src/core/ext/filters/http/client/http_client_filter.cc","file_line":134,"grpc_message":"Received http2 header with status: 502","grpc_status":14,"value":"502"}"
