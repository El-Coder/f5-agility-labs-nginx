This implementation assumes the following environment:

The identity provider (IdP) supports OpenID Connect 1.0
The authorization code flow is in use
NGINX Plus is configured as a relying party
The IdP knows NGINX Plus as a confidential client or a public client using PKCE
With this environment, both the client and NGINX Plus communicate directly with the IdP at different stages during the initial authentication event.
