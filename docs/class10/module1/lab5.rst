NGINX Plus API Dynamic Configuration
====================================

Introduction
------------

NGINX Plus enables configuration of upstream servers in a server group
to be modified on-the-fly without reloading the NGINX servers and its
configuration files. This is useful for:

-  **Autoscaling**, when you need to add more servers
-  **Maintenance**, when you need to remove a server, specify a backup
   server, or take a server down temporarily
-  **Quick setup**, when you need to change upstream server settings
   such as server weight, active connections, slow start, failure
   timeouts.
-  **Monitoring**, when you get the state of the server or server group
   with one command

All these changes are made with the NGINX Plus REST API interface with
API commands. By default changes made with the API are only stored only
in the shared memory zone and so the changes are discarded when the
NGINX Plus configuration file is reloaded.

In this Module we will configure upstream servers and upstream server
groups dynamically (on-the-fly) with the NGINX Plus REST API and use the
``state`` directive so on-the-fly configurations persistent through
NGINX reloads.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of the lab you will be able to:

-  Use the NGINX Plus API to dynamicly configure NGINX upstreams groups
-  Persist dyanmic reconfigurations using a ``state`` file
-  Interact with the NGINX Plus API using both
   `Postman <https://www.postman.com>`__ and
   ```cURL`` <https://curl.haxx.se>`__

Exercise 1: Dynamic Configuration of an Upstream using the NGINX API using Postman
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will use ``Postman`` to interact with the NGINX API.
In the Optional section below, we can reproduce the same steps using
``curl``

1.  In the ``WORKSPACE`` folder found on the desktop, open
    ``NGINX-PLUS-1`` in Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

    .. figure:: images/2020-06-29_15-55.png
       :alt: Select workspace

       Select workspace

2.  In the VSCode, open a a **terminal window**, using
    ``View > Terminal menu`` command. You will now be able to both run
    NGINX commands and edit NGINX Plus configuration files via the
    VSCode Console and terminal. (SSH access via Putty is also available
    as a SSH remote terminal access option.)

    .. figure:: images/2020-06-29_16-02_1.png
       :alt: terminal inside vscode

       terminal inside vscode

3.  Now inspect the ``/etc/nginx/conf.d/upstreams.conf`` file. Note the
    following:

    -  The ``zone`` directive configures a zone in the shared memory and
       sets the zone name and size. The configuration of the server
       group is kept in this zone, so all worker processes use the same
       configuration. In our example, the ``zone`` is also named
       ``dynamic`` and is ``64k`` megabyte in size.

    -  The ``state`` directive configures Persistence of Dynamic
       Configuration by writing the state information to a file that
       persists during a reload. The recommended path for Linux
       distributions is ``/var/lib/nginx/state/``

       .. code:: nginx

          # /etc/nginx/conf.d/upstream.conf 

          upstream dynamic {
              # Specify a file that keeps the state of the dynamically configurable group:
              state /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf;

              zone dynamic 64k;

              # Including keep alive connections are bonus points
              keepalive 32;
          }

4.  In the Terminal window, on the NGINX plus instance, ensure that the
    ``state`` file is at a empty state for this demo. Delete the file
    (if exists), then create an empty file:

    .. code:: bash

       $> rm /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf
       rm: cannot remove '/var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf': No such file or directory

    Then run:

    .. code:: bash

       $> touch /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf

5.  In a Web Browser, open the NGINX dashboard on
    ```http://www.example.com:8080/dashboard.html`` <http://www.example.com:8080/dashboard.html>`__.
    There is a bookmark in the Chrome Web Browser. Navigate to
    ``HTTP Upstreams``, and note that the ``dynamic`` is empty:

    .. figure:: images/2020-06-23_16-26.png
       :alt: nginx plus dashboard showing the empty dynamic upstream

       nginx plus dashboard showing the empty dynamic upstream

6.  Open ``Postman`` tool found on the desktop. For this demo we would
    be making use of the ``Dynamic Configuration`` collection.

7.  Open ``Check dynamic servers`` request and execute the call by
    clicking on ``Send`` button. We can confirm from the empty state of
    our upstream, ``dynamic``, from the response that we receive from
    the NGINX API.

    .. figure:: images/dc1_2020-08-26.png
       :alt: Check dynamic servers

       Check dynamic servers

8.  Lets now add a two servers, ``web1`` (``10.1.1.5:80``) and ``web2``
    (``10.1.1.6:80``) to the ``dynamic`` upstream group using the API.

    Open ``Add web1 to dynamic`` and ``Add web2 to dynamic`` requests
    and run them as shown below.

    |Add web1 postman| |Add web2 postman|

9.  Lets now add ``web3`` (``10.1.1.7:80``), **marked as down**, to the
    ``dynamic`` upstream group using the API

    Using ``Postman`` tool:

    .. figure:: images/dc4_2020-08-26.png
       :alt: Add web3 postman

       Add web3 postman

10. Once again list out the servers in our upstream, ``dynamic``, and
    view the changes made

    Using ``Postman`` tool:

    .. figure:: media/dc5_2020-08-26.png
       :alt: list servers postman

       list servers postman

11. We can also confirm that the state file has been updated:

    .. code:: bash

       $> cat /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf

       $> cat /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf

       server 10.1.1.5:80;
       server 10.1.1.6:80;
       server 10.1.1.7:80 slow_start=10s backup down;

12. It is possible to also remove a server from the upstream group:

    Using ``Postman`` tool:

    .. figure:: media/dc6_2020-08-26.png
       :alt: remove server postman

       remove server postman

13. To modify our ``down`` server back to rotation and accept live
    traffic, we need to change the server parameter from ``down: true``
    to ``down: false``. We first must find the server ID:

    Using ``Postman`` tool:

    Run the ``Check dynamic servers`` request to get the list of
    servers. From the response body note down the ``id`` value for the
    block that has the server parameter ``down: true``

    .. figure:: media/dc7_2020-08-26.png
       :alt: List server postman

       List server postman

14. Now that we have identified the server id, (e.g.Â ``"id: 2"``) we can
    modify the ``down`` parameter:

    Using ``Postman`` tool:

    .. figure:: media/dc8_2020-08-26.png
       :alt: List server postman

       List server postman

15. Once again, list out servers in our upstream, ``dynamic``

    Using ``Postman`` tool:

    .. figure:: media/dc10_2020-08-27.png
       :alt: List server postman

       List server postman

16. We can check the that the ``state`` file are making our upstream
    changes persistent by reloading NGINX and checking the dashboard and
    API

    .. code:: bash

       # inspect the state of out state file:
       $> cat /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf

       $> server 10.1.1.6:80;
       $> server 10.1.1.7:80 slow_start=10s backup;

       # Reload NGINX
       $> nginx -s reload

    **Note:** After a NGINX reload, the server ``id`` is reset to start
    at ``0``:

    .. figure:: media/dc11_2020-08-26.png
       :alt: List server postman

Optional: Dynamic Configuration of an Upstream using the NGINX API using cURL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we will use ``curl`` to interact with the NGINX API.

1. In the ``WORKSPACE`` folder found on the desktop, open
   ``NGINX-PLUS-1`` in Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

.. figure:: media/2020-06-29_15-55.png
   :alt: Select workspace

   Select workspace

2. In the VSCode, open a a **terminal window**, using
   ``View > Terminal menu`` command. You will now be able to both run
   NGINX commands and edit NGINX Plus configuration files via the VSCode
   Console and terminal. (SSH access via Putty is also available as a
   SSH remote terminal access option.)

   .. figure:: media/2020-06-29_16-02_1.png
      :alt: terminal inside vscode

      terminal inside vscode

3. Now inspect the ``/etc/nginx/conf.d/upstreams.conf`` file. Note the
   following:

   -  The ``zone`` directive configures a zone in the shared memory and
      sets the zone name and size. The configuration of the server group
      is kept in this zone, so all worker processes use the same
      configuration. In our example, the ``zone`` is also named
      ``dynamic`` and is ``64k`` megabyte in size.

   -  The ``state`` directive configures Persistence of Dynamic
      Configuration by writing the state information to a file that
      persists during a reload. The recommended path for Linux
      distributions is ``/var/lib/nginx/state/``

      .. code:: nginx

         # /etc/nginx/conf.d/upstream.conf 

         upstream dynamic {
             # Specify a file that keeps the state of the dynamically configurable group:
             state /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf;

             zone dynamic 64k;

             # Including keep alive connections are bonus points
             keepalive 32;
         }

4. In the Terminal window, on the NGINX plus instance, ensure that the
   ``state`` file is at a empty state for this demo. Delete the file (if
   exists), then create an empty file:

   .. code:: bash

      $> rm /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf
      rm: cannot remove '/var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf': No such file or directory

   Then run:

   .. code:: bash

      $> touch /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf

5. In a Web Browser, open the NGINX dashboard on
   ```http://www.example.com:8080/dashboard.html`` <http://www.example.com:8080/dashboard.html>`__.
   There is a bookmark in the Chrome Web Browser. Navigate to
   ``HTTP Upstreams``, and note that the ``dynamic`` is empty:

.. figure:: media/2020-06-23_16-26.png
   :alt: nginx plus dashboard showing the empty dynamic upstream

   nginx plus dashboard showing the empty dynamic upstream

6. In the Terminal window, we can also confirm the empty state of our
   upstream, ``dynamic``, using our a ``curl`` command to retrieve this
   information from the NGINX API

.. code:: bash

   $> curl -s http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers | jq

   []

7.  Lets now add a two servers, ``web1`` (``10.1.1.5:80``) and ``web2``
    (``10.1.1.6:80``) to the ``dynamic`` upstream group using the API

    .. code:: bash

       # Add web1 - 10.1.1.5:80
       $> curl -s -X \
       POST http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers \
       -H 'Content-Type: text/json; charset=utf-8' \
       -d '{
         "server": "10.1.1.5:80",
         "weight": 1,
         "max_conns": 0,
         "max_fails": 1,
         "fail_timeout": "10s",
         "slow_start": "0s",
         "route": "",
         "backup": false,
         "down": false
       }'

       # Add web2 - 10.1.1.6:80
       $> curl -s -X \
       POST http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers \
       -H 'Content-Type: text/json; charset=utf-8' \
       -d '{
         "server": "10.1.1.6:80",
         "weight": 1,
         "max_conns": 0,
         "max_fails": 1,
         "fail_timeout": "10s",
         "slow_start": "0s",
         "route": "",
         "backup": false,
         "down": false
       }'

    .. figure:: media/2020-06-29_21-52.png

       add web1

    .. figure:: media/2020-06-29_21-54.png
       :alt: add web2

       add web2

8.  Lets now add ``web3`` (``10.1.1.7:80``), **marked as down**, to the
    ``dynamic`` upstream group using the API

    .. code:: bash

       # Add web3 - 10.1.1.7:80
       $> curl -s -X \
       POST http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers \
       -H 'Content-Type: text/json; charset=utf-8' \
       -d '{
       "server": "10.1.1.7:80",
       "weight": 1,
       "max_conns": 0,
       "max_fails": 1,
       "fail_timeout": "10s",
       "slow_start": "10s",
       "route": "",
       "backup": true,
       "down": true
       }'

    .. figure:: media/2020-06-29_21-56.png
       :alt: add web3

       add web3

9.  Once again list out the servers in our upstream, ``dynamic``, and
    view the changes made

    .. code:: json

       curl -s http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers | jq
       [
         {
           "id": 0,
           "server": "10.1.1.5:80",
           "weight": 1,
           "max_conns": 0,
           "max_fails": 1,
           "fail_timeout": "10s",
           "slow_start": "0s",
           "route": "",
           "backup": false,
           "down": false
         },
         {
           "id": 1,
           "server": "10.1.1.6:80",
           "weight": 1,
           "max_conns": 0,
           "max_fails": 1,
           "fail_timeout": "10s",
           "slow_start": "0s",
           "route": "",
           "backup": false,
           "down": false
         },
         {
           "id": 2,
           "server": "10.1.1.7:80",
           "weight": 1,
           "max_conns": 0,
           "max_fails": 1,
           "fail_timeout": "10s",
           "slow_start": "10s",
           "route": "",
           "backup": true,
           "down": true
         }
       ]

10. We can also confirm that the state file has been updated:

    .. code:: bash

       $> cat /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf

       $> cat /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf

       server 10.1.1.5:80;
       server 10.1.1.6:80;
       server 10.1.1.7:80 slow_start=10s backup down;

11. It is possible to also remove a server from the upstream group:

    .. code:: bash

       $> curl -X DELETE -s http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers/0 | jq
       [
         {
           "id": 1,
           "server": "10.1.1.6:80",
           "weight": 1,
           "max_conns": 0,
           "max_fails": 1,
           "fail_timeout": "10s",
           "slow_start": "0s",
           "route": "",
           "backup": false,
           "down": false
         },
         {
           "id": 2,
           "server": "10.1.1.7:80",
           "weight": 1,
           "max_conns": 0,
           "max_fails": 1,
           "fail_timeout": "10s",
           "slow_start": "10s",
           "route": "",
           "backup": true,
           "down": true
         }
       ]

    .. figure:: media/2020-06-29_21-58.png
       :alt: remove server

       remove server

12. To modify our ``down`` server back to rotation and accept live
    traffic, we need to change the server parameter from ``down: true``
    to ``down: false``. We first must find the server ID:

    .. code:: bash

       # Find the ID of the down server i.e '"down": true', i.e. live
       $> curl -s http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers | jq '.[]  | select(.down==true)'

       {
         "id": 2,
         "server": "10.1.1.7:80",
         "weight": 1,
         "max_conns": 0,
         "max_fails": 1,
         "fail_timeout": "10s",
         "slow_start": "10s",
         "route": "",
         "backup": true,
         "down": true
       }

13. Now that we have identified the server id, (e.g.Â ``"id: 2"``) we can
    modify the ``down`` parameter:

    .. code:: bash

       # Set server to '"down": false', i.e. live
       $> curl -X PATCH -d '{ "down": false }' -s 'http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers/2'

       {"id":2,"server":"10.1.1.7:80","weight":1,"max_conns":0,"max_fails":1,"fail_timeout":"10s","slow_start":"10s","route":"","backup":true,"down":false}

14. Once again, list out servers in our upstream, ``dynamic``

    .. code:: bash

       $> curl -s http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers | jq

.. figure:: media/2020-06-29_22-02.png
   :alt: server list

   server list

13. We can check the that the ``state`` file are making our upstream
    changes persistent by reloading NGINX and checking the dashboard and
    API

    .. code:: bash

       # inspect the state of out state file:
       $> cat /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf

       $> server 10.1.1.6:80;
       $> server 10.1.1.7:80 slow_start=10s backup;

       # Reload NGINX
       $> nginx -s reload

    **Note:** After a NGINX reload, the server ``id`` is reset to start
    at ``0``:

    \`\`\ ``bash # Lastly, list out servers in our upstream,``\ dynamic\`
    $> curl -s
    http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers \| jq
