Lab 1.2 - UDF pattern systems walk through
==========================================

This lab will be primarily Q&A about the UDF pattern, to help familiarize you with the patterns' elements. Feel free to look around.

.. important::
   While you are encouraged to explore, it is not recommended that any configuration changes are made. The only real interactions we will have with the UDF pattern at this stage is to access the console for the "dev" system.
   
Once we have had a chance to discuss the pattern, we will complete the short set of steps below to access the "dev" system.

   #. Locate and click on the components tab in the center of the screen.
   #. Locate the system "dev".
   #. From the Access drop down menu click the down arrow and select "console".
   #. On the left side of the scree you will see a grey pop out menu if you would like this can be used to maximize the window or tab to full screen. (optional)

Recap
-----
You now have the following:

   - Explored the UDP Pattern.
   - Gone through the important elements with the instructor.
   - Accessed the "dev" system via the console option.

Next we'll explore the dev system where we will be conducting all of our work.
